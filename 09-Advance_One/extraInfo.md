# Synchronous
- Tasks are completed one after another, in the order they appear.
- The next task waits until the current task is done.
  

# Asynchronous :

Tasks donâ€™t wait for each other. While one task is being processed, JavaScript can start another.
Useful for tasks that take time, like fetching data or waiting for a timer.
